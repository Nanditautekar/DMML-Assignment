# Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline

## 1. Business Problem

Customer churn occurs when an existing customer stops using a company’s services or purchasing its products. This results in revenue declines and increases the cost pressure on customer acquisition efforts. In addition, churn has indirect effects as former customers might influence loyal customers to switch to competitors. Addressing churn is crucial for maintaining a stable customer base and ensuring sustainable revenue growth.

## 2. Business Objectives

- **Reduce Churn Rates:** Identify and proactively engage with at-risk customers to minimize churn.
- **Stabilize Revenue:** Retain existing customers to offset revenue losses due to churn.
- **Enhance Cost Efficiency:** Lower customer acquisition costs by focusing on retention strategies.
- **Gain Competitive Edge:** Prevent the spillover effect where churned customers influence others to join competitors.

## 3. Key Data Sources and Attributes

- **Web Logs:**
  - Attributes: Session duration, click patterns, page visits, user engagement metrics.
- **Transactional Systems:**
  - Attributes: Transaction history, purchase frequency, recency, monetary values (e.g., RFM metrics).
- **Third-Party APIs:**
  - Attributes: Demographic information, credit scores, additional behavioral data.
- **Additional Sources (Optional):**
  - Customer support interactions, survey responses, social media activity.

## 4. Pipeline Outputs

- **Clean Datasets for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Standardized and quality-checked datasets ready for analysis.
- **Transformed Features for Machine Learning:**
  - Engineered features (such as RFM metrics and temporal features) that encapsulate customer behavior.
- **Deployable Churn Prediction Model:**
  - A machine learning model that has been trained, validated, and packaged (e.g., as a REST API) for real-time or batch predictions.

## 5. Evaluation Metrics

- **Model Performance Metrics:**
  - **Accuracy:** Overall correctness of the model’s predictions.
  - **Precision & Recall:** The model's ability to correctly identify churners and non-churners.
  - **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
  - **AUC-ROC:** The model’s ability to distinguish between classes.
- **Business Impact Metrics:**
  - **Churn Rate Reduction:** Measured change in churn rates after implementation.
  - **Customer Retention Rate:** Improvement in the percentage of retained customers.
  - **Cost Savings:** Reduction in customer acquisition costs due to enhanced retention efforts.
